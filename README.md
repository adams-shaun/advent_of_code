# advent_of_code

## info

A former colleague of mine told me about this coding challenge.  I'm starting to prepare again for software engineering interviews and it seemed like a nice change of pace from daily coding problem or leetcode exercises.

I'll be working through these challenges, but not attempting to climb any leaderboards.  My primary focus is to work on solutions in languages that I have not interviewed with and committing to memory many of the patterns needed to solve coding challenges in a timely manner.
